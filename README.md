# express-boilerplate
An empty express app with authentication already set up.
This is meant to be ready for quick prototyping but also to be solid enough to build out into a full on production app if one of those prototypes turns out to be any good.

This is based heavily off https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local
If you're interested - they have their own repo.
I just preffered a slightly different set up!

Build tools: none 
Front End Framework: none
Templating: moustach!  (but it's easy to change)

---

Ideas for the future:

* better encryption
* branch per front end framework? maybe
